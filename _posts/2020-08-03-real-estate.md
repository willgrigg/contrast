I posted a video a few days ago that featured a simple cURL command that makes it a hell of a lot easier to download a list of HUD homes off of [hudhomestore.com](https://www.hudhomestore.com).

Here's the command itself:

```

curl -o output_file.xls https://www.hudhomestore.com/pages/ListExportToExcel.aspx

```
