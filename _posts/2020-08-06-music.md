One of the best command line tools I use regularly is youtube-dl. It's just endlessly useful, and I hope that my most recent video demonstrates some of its functionality well.

Here's a quick rundown of what I do in the video, minus the fluff and extra bandwidth required. I assume that you already have youtube-dl installed.

<strong>step 1: download a playlist with youtube-dl</strong>

It's pretty much that simple. Just find one of those auto-generated artist topic pages on YouTube and grab a link to a playlist for one of their albums. Use this command to format everything neatly while downloading:

```

youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 -o "%(playlist_index)s. %(title)s.%(ext)s" https://www.youryoutubeplaylistlink.biz

```

You're pretty much already done at this point. However, if you'd like to make a nice playlist of the songs you just downloaded, you'll need the following step:

<strong>step 2 (optional): create a playlist</strong>

From within the directory that you have downloaded the songs, do this:

```

playlist=$(basename "$(pwd)")
ls -1 *.mp3 > "$playlist".m3u

```
Nice and straightforward. To listen to your playlist, just click on the .m3u file. Good times, noodle salad
