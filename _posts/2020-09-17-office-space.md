One of the things that you'll hear all the time growing up (at least if you're from a small town -- I can't vouch for more urban areas) is the importance of hard work. To many people, hard work is not just the key to success, it's a virtue. There is definitely some truth to this -- the only way to get good at anything is to practice and practice until you're not terrible.

However, the idea that hard work alone will set you apart from the crowd and help you achieve whatever you believe to be "success" is absolute horseshit.

Why do I think this? The biggest reason is simply because most people do not apply their work properly. Let's say you have two employees of a company: <strong>employee 1</strong> and <strong>employee 2</strong>.

<strong>Employee 1</strong> is a model worker; he comes in early and leaves late. He'll sacrifice precious weekend time to hammer out a project that needs to get done before Monday. He never takes lunch breaks. He makes $12/hr.

<strong>Employee 2</strong> is a much more average worker -- maybe even on the lazy side, but he's still likable and amicable. He clearly values his time above the company's. He does the bare minimum. He makes $12/hr.

Based on what I've told you, what is the one thing these two have in common, besides the fact that they make the same amount of money? <em>They are both entirely replaceable</em>. Now that you have that in mind, which one would you rather be? 

Correct! <strong>Employee 2!</strong>

It's very important to realize that almost no one employing you will actually care whether or not you work harder than everyone else, because this is something that <strong>literally anyone</strong> can do. Working hard is not some special talent, it's just as simple as it sounds. And it <strong>DOES NOT</strong> make you stand out from the crowd.

What has <strong>actual value</strong> is having unique and valuable skills that will make you <strong>less replaceable</strong>. These skills come not from mindlessly working as hard as you can for some soul-sucking company, they come from you <strong>investing your time in yourself.</strong>

If a company is a human body, you don't want to be a red blood cell. You want to be the brain, or the heart, or the lungs, or even the pancreas. Work hard if you have to, but more importantly, <strong>find your niche in a company and exploit it</strong>.

TL;DR: Watch <em>Office Space</em>.
